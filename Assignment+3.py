# # Assignment 3 - Evaluation
# 
# In this assignment you will train several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based on [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud).
#  
# Each row in `fraud_data.csv` corresponds to a credit card transaction. Features include confidential variables `V1` through `V28` as well as `Amount` which is the amount of the transaction. 
#  
# The target is stored in the `class` column, where a value of 1 corresponds to an instance of fraud and 0 corresponds to an instance of not fraud.

# In[1]:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


# ### Question 1
# Import the data from `fraud_data.csv`. What percentage of the observations in the dataset are instances of fraud?
# 
# *This function should return a float between 0 and 1.* 

# In[2]:

def answer_one():
    
    fraud_df = pd.read_csv("fraud_data.csv")
    fraud_df_1 = fraud_df[fraud_df['Class']==1]
    
    return (fraud_df_1.shape[0]/fraud_df.shape[0])


# In[3]:

# Use X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test for all of the following questions
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

df = pd.read_csv('fraud_data.csv')

X = df.iloc[:,:-1]
y = df.iloc[:,-1]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)


# ### Question 2
# 
# Using `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` (as defined above), train a dummy classifier that classifies everything as the majority class of the training data. What is the accuracy of this classifier? What is the recall?
# 
# *This function should a return a tuple with two floats, i.e. `(accuracy score, recall score)`.*

# In[4]:

def answer_two():
    from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
    

    dummy_majority = DummyClassifier(strategy = 'most_frequent').fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_dummy_predictions = dummy_majority.predict(X_test)
    acc_score = dummy_majority.score(X_test, y_test)
    recall_s = recall_score(y_test, y_dummy_predictions)
    
    # Your code here
    
    return (acc_score,recall_s)


# ### Question 3
# 
# Using X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test (as defined above), train a SVC classifer using the default parameters. What is the accuracy, recall, and precision of this classifier?
# 
# *This function should a return a tuple with three floats, i.e. `(accuracy score, recall score, precision score)`.*

# In[5]:

def answer_three():
    from sklearn.metrics import recall_score, precision_score
    from sklearn.svm import SVC

    svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1).fit(X_train, y_train)
    svm_predicted = svm.predict(X_test)
    acc_s = svm.score(X_test, y_test)
    rec_s = recall_score(y_test, svm_predicted)
    pre_s = precision_score(y_test, svm_predicted)
    
    return (acc_s,rec_s,pre_s)


# ### Question 4
# 
# Using the SVC classifier with parameters `{'C': 1e9, 'gamma': 1e-07}`, what is the confusion matrix when using a threshold of -220 on the decision function. Use X_test and y_test.
# 
# *This function should return a confusion matrix, a 2x2 numpy array with 4 integers.*

# In[8]:

def answer_four():
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    from sklearn.svm import SVC

    svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1e9, gamma=1e-07).fit(X_train, y_train)
    predicted = svm.decision_function(X_test) > -220
    confusion = confusion_matrix(y_test, predicted)
    
    return confusion
answer_four()


# ### Question 5
# 
# Train a logisitic regression classifier with default parameters using X_train and y_train.
# 
# For the logisitic regression classifier, create a precision recall curve and a roc curve using y_test and the probability estimates for X_test (probability it is fraud).
# 
# Looking at the precision recall curve, what is the recall when the precision is `0.75`?
# 
# Looking at the roc curve, what is the true positive rate when the false positive rate is `0.16`?
# 
# *This function should return a tuple with two floats, i.e. `(recall, true positive rate)`.*

# In[ ]:

def answer_five():
    
    return (0.83, 0.94)


# ### Question 6
# 
# Perform a grid search over the parameters listed below for a Logisitic Regression classifier, using recall for scoring and the default 3-fold cross validation.
# 
# `'penalty': ['l1', 'l2']`
# 
# `'C':[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]`
# 
# From `.cv_results_`, create an array of the mean test scores of each parameter combination. i.e.
# 
# |      	| `l1` 	| `l2` 	|
# |:----:	|----	|----	|
# | **`0.01`** 	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`0.1`**  	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`1`**    	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`10`**   	|    ?	|   ? 	|
# | **`100`**   	|    ?	|   ? 	|
#

# 
# *This function should return a 5 by 2 numpy array with 10 floats.* 
# 
# *Note: do not return a DataFrame, just the values denoted by '?' above in a numpy array. You might need to reshape your raw result to meet the format we are looking for.*
